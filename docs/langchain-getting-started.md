# ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Getting Started with LangChain

---

LangChain is a Python framework for building applications powered by language models. This guide walks through creating a minimal project so you can start experimenting.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An OpenAI API key (or another LLM provider supported by LangChain)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install langchain openai
```

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key before running any code.

## 2. Example Project Structure

```
langchain-hello/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` contains:

```
langchain
openai
```

## 3. Writing `app.py`

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain

# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# A simple prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a fun fact about {topic}.")

# Create the chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain with a variable
print(chain.run({"topic": "penguins"}))
```

Running `python app.py` will print a single fun fact generated by the LLM.

## 4. Next Steps

- Experiment with other prompts or models
- Explore additional LangChain components such as chains, agents and memory
- Review the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/) for more examples

With this simple setup you can start building and iterating on LLM-powered ideas.
